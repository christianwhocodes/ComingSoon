## ⚙️ GitHub Pages Configuration

Before your site can be published, make sure to configure GitHub Pages correctly:

1. **Repository Visibility:**  
   Your repository must be **public** for GitHub Pages to deploy.

2. **Set Pages Source:**  
   Go to your repo’s **Settings** → **Pages**.  
   - Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source** to **GitHub Actions** (not from a branch).

3. **First Deployment:**  
   After pushing to `main`, the GitHub Actions workflow will build and deploy your site.  
   The published site URL will be shown in the Pages settings and in the Actions logs.

4. **Troubleshooting:**  
   - If you see a 404, wait a few minutes for GitHub Pages to process the deployment.
   - Ensure your workflow completed successfully and the repo is public.

## 🚀 Deploying

Just push to the `main` branch—GitHub Actions will build and publish your site automatically!

## 🧪 Testing Your Site Locally

You can preview your site on your computer before pushing changes.

### Option 1: Install Jekyll on Your Computer

#### Step 1: Install Ruby and Jekyll

**Windows (PowerShell as Administrator):**
```powershell
winget search ruby
winget install RubyInstallerTeam.RubyWithDevKit.3.2

# Add Ruby to your PATH (if not already added).
# Replace 'C:\Ruby32-x64\bin' with your actual Ruby install path if different

[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", $env:Path + ";C:\Ruby32-x64\bin", [System.EnvironmentVariableTarget]::Machine)

# Restart your PowerShell terminal
# You may need to restart your PC if `gem` is not found
# Admin shell not necessary
gem install jekyll bundler
```

**Mac:**
```sh
brew install ruby
gem install jekyll bundler
```

**Linux (Ubuntu):**
```sh
sudo apt-get install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev
gem install jekyll bundler
```

#### Step 2: In your project folder

```sh
# First time only
bundle install

# Every time you want to test
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

To use a different port (e.g., 3000):

```sh
bundle exec jekyll serve --port 3000
```

#### Step 3: Open your browser

Visit [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) (or your chosen port).

Happy building! 🌟
