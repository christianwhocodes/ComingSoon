## ‚öôÔ∏è GitHub Pages Configuration

Before your site can be published, make sure to configure GitHub Pages correctly:

1. **Repository Visibility:**  
   Your repository must be **public** for GitHub Pages to deploy.

2. **Set Pages Source:**  
   Go to your repo‚Äôs **Settings** ‚Üí **Pages**.  
   - Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source** to **GitHub Actions** (not from a branch).

3. **First Deployment:**  
   After pushing to `main`, the GitHub Actions workflow will build and deploy your site.  
   The published site URL will be shown in the Pages settings and in the Actions logs.

4. **Troubleshooting:**  
   - If you see a 404, wait a few minutes for GitHub Pages to process the deployment.
   - Ensure your workflow completed successfully and the repo is public.

## üöÄ Deploying

Just push to the `main` branch‚ÄîGitHub Actions will build and publish your site automatically!
